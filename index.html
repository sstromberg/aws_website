			<h1>Sam Stromberg</h1>
			<p>I'm an Oakland resident who enjoys hikes with my dogs, iced coffee, and solving problems; this is my website. It's written from scratch and hosted on AWS, not because I want to be a web dev, but because it's fun to see a project through from start to finish -- in this case from "I guess I should have a website" to typing in a URL and seeing it pop up.</p>
			<p>This is my dog Franklin; he looks like this most of the time. I can only aspire to his level of enthusiasm.</p>

			<p>I volunteer at Oakland Animal Services, where I work with a lot of <a href="http://www.oaklandanimalservices.org/adopt/dogs/">good dogs</a> to get them ready for adoption, through training, behavioral interventions, and socialization. Every week, I'm impressed anew by their resilience and capacity to trust and to learn.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>Somewhat organized on my <a href="https://github.com/sstromberg">github</a> page.</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/sstromberg/aws_website">This website</a> -- I figured it's only fair to make the whole site available. Also I like that it links to itself.</p>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/sstromberg/nba-project">Quantifying NBA defense</a> -- While NBA team defense is reasonably well-addressed by Defensive Rating, distributing credit among individual players is more difficult. The current generation of publicly-available advanced stats are derived primarily from components in the standard box score. Meanwhile, the advent of real-time player-tracking systems have enabled teams and private companies to build extremely detailed (and proprietary) metrics. The NBA has released some measures abstracted from this tracking data, and so I'm trying to use it to bridge the gap while we wait for the good stuff to trickle out.</p>

			<li>Gabel JR, Arnold DR, Fulton BD, <b>Stromberg ST</b>, Green M, Whitmore H, Scheffler RM. "Consumers Buy Lower-Cost Plans On Covered California, Suggesting Exposure To Premium Increases Is Less Than Commonly Reported." <i>Health Affairs</i>, Vol. 36 No. 1 (January 2017): 8-15. Online <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0902">here</a>.</li>
			<p>California was the first state to release data on actual plan-purchase decisions for the individual health insurance market; other states and the federal government have to date only released enrollments in aggregate. Therefore, while quantifying the increase in premium costs from year to year was a key research question, we could only estimate them based on the set of plans offered in the market. Researchers have used methods from a simple average of all offered plans to complex weighting schemes to approximate enrollment (by geography and metal tier, for example); with this California data, our team was able to assess the accuracy of these estimates, relative to actual consumer behavior.</p>
			<li>Hoadley J, Summer L, Hargrave E, <b>Stromberg ST</b>, Cubanski J, and Neuman T. "To Switch or Be Switched: Examining Changes in Drug Plan Enrollment among Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy Enrollees." Kaiser Family Foundation study, online <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/report/to-switch-or-be-switched-examining-changes-in-drug-plan-enrollment-among-medicare-part-d-low-income-subsidy-enrollees/">here</a>.
			<p>Enrollees in Medicare Part D who receive financial assistance due to their income have a limited set of plans in which they can enroll with zero out-of-pocket monthly premium costs. This menu of plans changes from year to year, as plan premiums and the amount of the subsidy change. If an enrollee's plan falls off of the zero-premium list, they will be notified, and if they do not actively choose a new plan, they will be randomly assigned to an eligible zero-premium plan. In this study, we explore the landscape of subsidy-eligible enrollees and their plan-switching behavior over several years.</p>
