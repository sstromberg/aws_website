			<h2>Sam Stromberg</h2>
			<h4>Oakland-based, data-driven</h4>
			<p>Everyone should have a website -- social media accounts are a snapshot view of life-in-progress, but it's nice to keep a curio cabinet, too. Or maybe that's not quite right, since you can tinker with a site over time... maybe a bin of lego blocks?</p>
			<p>Sam is an Oakland resident who enjoys hikes with his dogs, iced coffee, and solving problems; this is his website. His dog Franklin enjoys pretty much everything; this is how he looks most of the time.</p>

"Consumers Buy Lower-Cost Plans On Covered California, Suggesting Exposure To Premium Increases Is Less Than Commonly Reported." <i>Health Affairs</i>, Vol. 36 No. 1 (January 2017): 8-15. Online <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0902">here</a>.</li>
			<p>California was the first state to release data on actual plan-purchase decisions for the individual health insurance market; other states and the federal government have to date only released enrollments in aggregate. Therefore, while quantifying the increase in premium costs from year to year was a key research question, we could only estimate them based on the set of plans offered in the market. Researchers have used methods from a simple average of all offered plans to complex weighting schemes to approximate enrollment (by geography and metal tier, for example); with this California data, our team was able to assess the accuracy of these estimates, relative to actual consumer behavior.</p>

"To Switch or Be Switched: Examining Changes in Drug Plan Enrollment among Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy Enrollees." Kaiser Family Foundation study, online <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/report/to-switch-or-be-switched-examining-changes-in-drug-plan-enrollment-among-medicare-part-d-low-income-subsidy-enrollees/">here</a>.
			<p>Enrollees in Medicare Part D who receive financial assistance due to their income have a limited set of plans in which they can enroll with zero out-of-pocket monthly premium costs. This menu of plans changes from year to year, as plan premiums and the amount of the subsidy change. If an enrollee's plan falls off of the zero-premium list, they will be notified, and if they do not actively choose a new plan, they will be randomly assigned to an eligible zero-premium plan. In this study, we explore the landscape of subsidy-eligible enrollees and their plan-switching behavior over several years.</p>
