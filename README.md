## code for my website

I realized I needed
1) a personal website
2) demonstrated experience using AWS

So I built a simple website from scratch and set up an AWS S3 bucket to store it. I have a custom domain name, so I did have to spend some time ping-ponging between AWS documentation and blogs written by people who have the same setup on how to get everything lined up. In addition, I routed the hosting through Cloudflare, so I could get a certificate and run on https, which helps a little with it looking nice in a browser (no INSECURE warning in the address bar).

There's nothing revolutionary here -- in particular, the site is not responsive -- but it is doable with just a little bit of html/CSS/how does the internet actually work knowledge.

I put the site up a little while ago, but realized that updates will be a little easier to manage using git.
